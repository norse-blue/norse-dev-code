# Discipline

Old Norse: _[`hógværi`][ref-old-norse]_

## Essence

Foster _`discipline`_ to uphold and reflect the beliefs and values you hold dear.

## Substance

_`Discipline`_ as a virtue is the ability to control oneself in favor of honoring the beliefs and values we chose to live by. It’s not always an easy task to be an ethical and just person, more so in today’s society — it often takes some degree of work, and a lot of mental _`discipline`_ to achieve it.

As we stated previously, upholding the virtues and values is a choice, and more often than not is much simpler to just ignore them and do what society expects from us or what comes easier. Our will plays a very important part of keeping us in check and continue on a righteous path.

This virtue can then understood as the suppression of base desires with restraint and self-control. When an individual uses reason to determine the best course of action regardless of their desires, which may be contrary to what must take place and allows the translation of raw impulse into _rational actions_ as opposed to _unconscious reactions_.

To honor one's beliefs and values, one must be willing to exercise the _`discipline`_ necessary to make it work, one must be willing to control one's actions. In this way, we limit ourselves in some ways, but we gain much more in others.

## Practice

For a _Norse Developer_, _`discipline`_ should allow us to honor our beliefs and values in spite of the context we find ourselves in our careers. Fostering _`discipline`_ can contribute to our decision making in favor of _what's best for me and others_, as opposed to _what's best for me even if it damages others_ (which seems to be the motto in today's society). Discipline will allow us to 
constraint our raw impulses and master our mind and soul to achieve self-control and help us follow the [Code of the Norse Developer][chapter-intro], staying true to the goals we have set for ourselves and our contribution to society.
