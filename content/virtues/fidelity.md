# Fidelity

Old Norse: _[`einorð`][ref-old-norse]_

## Essence

Being faithful to oneself, our beliefs and values and the community in which we exert our careers.

## Substance

The Nine Noble Virtues all tie in together — if you fail to adhere to one, you may have trouble following the others. The concept of _`fidelity`_ is complex yet simple at the same time: it involves faithfulness to a person, cause, community and/or belief which is demonstrated by continual loyalty and support.

While commonly associated with sexual faithfulness to a spouse or partner, in the broader sense of the concept, _`fidelity`_ incorporates loyalty and support to one's community, family, cause and one's belief system and moral values.

Much like honor, _`fidelity`_ is something to always have in mind. In many early [heathen][def-heathen] cultures, an oath was seen as a sacred contract — someone who broke a vow, whether it was to a wife, a friend, or a business partner or the community, was considered a shameful and dishonorable person indeed. If you let down a friend or member of your kindred, then you were turning your back on your entire community and all that they stand for.

## Practice

A _Norse Developer_ has to have _`fidelity`_ to stay true to oneself, the [Code of the Norse Developer][chapter-intro] and the community in which our careers unfold. _[`Einorð`][ref-old-norse]_ goes well beyond loyalty, it is a deep, determined loyalty of a special kind, right to the core, to our principles and values.

We, as _Norse Developers_ should bear true faith and allegiance to ourselves, our brothers and the virtues depicted in the [Code of the Norse Developer][chapter-intro] and thus remain complete and undivided. We should strive to mainain a firm adherence to one’s moral values and beliefs.
