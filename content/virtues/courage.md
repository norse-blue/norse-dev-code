# Courage

Old Norse: _`áræði`_

## Essence

Have courage to stand up for what you believe in and defend your values.

## Description

Courage (sometimes referred to as _valiance_ or _valor_) is the ability of someone to act upon even at the hint of fear. It can also be understood as doing something that is known to be difficult or dangerous; to have strength in the face of grief or pain.

In virtually every statement of values found in the Old Norse culture, _`courage`_ is given the utmost most importance. _`Courage`_ and bravery are perhaps the values that the Vikings are best known for.  But _`courage`_ in this context is not necessarily about running into a fight with a war cry swinging your axe from side to side.

This value can be understood more like a moral _`courage`_: standing up for what you believe in and what you know to be right and just, even if it is not the popular opinion, and act accordingly (note that acting is a necessity, as failing to do so would be acting _cowardly_ and thus not fulfilling the _courageous_ capacity of an _Old Norse_ warrior). Living your beliefs in the face of struggle requires as much courage as going into
battle.

## Substance

For a _norse developer_, having _`courage`_ means to stand up for one's beliefs and defend the values that we follow in the context of our careers (certainly aligned to those we follow in our life). It means that _`courage`_ has to lead our way and be our banner to remind us in every decision we make of the values we have embraced by following the [Code of the Norse Developer][chapter-intro].
