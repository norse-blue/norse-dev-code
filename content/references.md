The work in this project has been inspired by many resources, the first of them being the writings of the Old Norse culture found in the [Poetic Edda][link-poetic-edda-wiki].

Along with it, we have taken the ideas and translations found across different sources which are listed here without any special order:

- [The Nine Noble Virtues â€“ Life Codes to Live by][ref-spanghelm]
- [Internet Book of Shadows: Nine Noble Virtues (Norse)][ref-sacred-texts]
- [The Nine Noble Virtues of Asatru][ref-learnreligions]
